  JavaScript at Wikibooks JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS,
  is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World
  Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript
  on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party
  libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
  execute the code on users' devices.
